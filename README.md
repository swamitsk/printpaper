# printpaper
An System Admin utility to estimate the cost of printing. 

The Main class will actually create all the dependency for the controller. The Main class once executed will provide the cost value for each print task and the total cost.

The Service class creates a CSV handler, Similarly we have implemenation for cost calculation service, this is specific to the A4 paper though.

Added the Test class for each of the services.
